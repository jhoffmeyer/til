title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):

- nils are considered objects

- array.pop will return the last value in an array and remove it from the array; while push will add to the end of the array.  A similar method can be done for the first value in the array using shirft and unshift

- hashes with the same values and keys will be equal, even if in a different order
